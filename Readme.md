# Sample Youtube 
### Uses the youtube API's to play youtube videos

## Setup

clone the project and run the below command

```
    ## install the dependencies
    yarn install
    ## start the project
    yarn start
```


Runs the app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

## Note: code is compatible for android, ios and web platform.
